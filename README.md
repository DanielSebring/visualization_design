Visualization Design Assignment

  In our dataset we have for this assignment, we have data about different bacteria and their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), which measures bacteria effectiveness.  There's also data about whether the bacteria are Gram-positive or Gram-negative.  I will be asking questions of this dataset using the persona of a scientist, who's trying to find trends in what makes bacteria dangerous (as defined by being the most resistant to antibiotics.)

Question 1:  Which strain of bacteria is most resistant to the three types of antibiotics?

For this, the researcher is looking for one specific type of bacteria- the most resistant type.  The researcher wants to be able to see the different bacteria across the three types of antibiotics, and be able to tell which of the types has the highest average IMC rank across the different bacteria.

Question 2:  Are the Gram-positive bacteria or the Gram-negative bacteria more resistant to Penicilin?

For this question, the researcher is looking for trends in different types of bacteria so they can isolate which types are most resistant to bacteria and therefore might need more research, funding, etc.  For this question, te researcher wants to be able to see only the results with Penicillin (maybe the researcher gets fundung from them, I don't know!)  That means it should be easy for him to tell the minimum inhibitory concentration for each bacteria.  The researcher is interested in which bacteria have the highest MIC as this would indicate that Penicilin was least effective against that type of bacteria.  The researcher also wants to be able to quickly see whether those bacteria that are most resistant to Penicilin are Gram-positive or Gram-negative, as that might indicate a trend.



Question 3: Which type of antibiotic is the most effective (compared to the other two?) on these bacteria?

For this, the researcher is interested in the three different antibiotics and their results across the different bacteria.  He wants to easily see what type of antiotic is causing the lowest average MIC across all the different bacteria, as that indicates the antibiotic is effective.  This is limited, since we don't have data on cost to produce, availability of antibiotic, etc. so we don't know if there are other contstraints.
